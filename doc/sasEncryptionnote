In SAS, it's crucial for a QA person to securely handle credentials within their code to ensure the protection of sensitive information. A recommended approach is to use SAS's built-in encryption methods to store and manage credentials. One commonly used method is the PROC PWENCODE procedure, which allows users to encode passwords into an encrypted format that can be safely included in the code. For example, the PROC PWENCODE can encode a password using the AES encryption algorithm, producing an encoded string that can then be used within LIBNAME or FILENAME statements securely. Additionally, storing credentials in an external file and using the INFILE or FILENAME statement to read them into the program dynamically ensures that sensitive information is not hard-coded into the SAS script.

Valid encryption methods in SAS include the use of AES, DES, and SASPROPRIETARY algorithms. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is highly recommended due to its strong encryption capabilities. During code reviews, QA personnel should flag any hard-coded plain text credentials, use of weak encryption methods like DES, or lack of encryption altogether as compromised data. They should also ensure that the storage mechanisms for credentials, such as external files or SAS metadata, are properly secured and access-controlled. Regular reviews and updates to encryption standards and practices should be conducted to maintain high levels of data security.
