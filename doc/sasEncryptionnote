**Secure Handling of Credentials in SAS: Best Practices for QA Professionals**

In SAS, it's crucial for a QA person to securely handle credentials within their code to ensure the protection of sensitive information. A recommended approach is to use SAS's built-in encryption methods to store and manage credentials. One commonly used method is the `PROC PWENCODE` procedure, which allows users to encode passwords into an encrypted format that can be safely included in the code. For example, the `PROC PWENCODE` can encode a password using the SASProprietary (SAS002) encryption algorithm, producing an encoded string that can then be used within `LIBNAME` or `FILENAME` statements securely. It is important to note that encoding methods like `SAS003` to `SAS005` cannot be placed into a password file since the encoded string changes every time it is generated. Therefore, `SAS002` is recommended for creating a consistent and repeatable password file.

To securely manage credentials, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Password File:**
   - Encode your password using the `PROC PWENCODE` procedure with the `SAS002` method:
     ```sas
     proc pwencode in='yourPassword' out='encodedPassword';
     run;
     ```
   - Save the encoded username and password in a file (e.g., `passwordfile.sas`):
     ```sas
     %let user=myUsername;
     %let password={sas002}encodedPassword;
     ```

2. **Modify File Permissions:**
   - Change the permissions of the password file to 700 so that only the owner can read it:
     ```bash
     chmod 700 passwordfile.sas
     ```

3. **Include the Password File in Your SAS Program:**
   - In your SAS program, include the password file at the beginning and set options to avoid printing the encrypted password in the log:
     ```sas
     options nosource2;
     %include 'path/to/passwordfile.sas';
     options source2;
     ```

Valid encryption methods in SAS include the use of AES, DES, and SASProprietary algorithms. AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) is highly recommended due to its strong encryption capabilities. During code reviews, QA personnel should flag any hard-coded plain text credentials, use of weak encryption methods like DES, or lack of encryption altogether as compromised data. They should also ensure that the storage mechanisms for credentials, such as external files or SAS metadata, are properly secured and access-controlled. Regular reviews and updates to encryption standards and practices should be conducted to maintain high levels of data security.
