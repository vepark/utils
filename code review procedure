Step 1: Understand the Scope and Objective
1.1. Review the Code: Start by understanding the common template code written by the LOB team. Review the documentation to understand its purpose, functionalities, and dependencies.
1.2. Define the Scope: Clearly define what aspects of the code will be covered in the sniff test and the end-to-end test.
Step 2: Pre-Test Setup
2.1. Gather Test Artifacts: Collect all related SQL files and any other necessary documentation from the LOB team.
2.2. Setup Test Environment: Ensure a separate test environment is set up that mirrors the production environment. This prevents any disruption to live systems.
2.3. Import the Code: Load the SQL files and any necessary data into the test environment.
Step 3: Conduct Sniff Testing
3.1. Quick Functional Check: Execute the SQL scripts to verify basic functionality. Check if scripts run without errors and perform their intended basic operations.
3.2. Validate Results: Briefly check the outputs for glaring issues. This step is not about deep verification but ensuring that the code does not fail catastrophically.
3.3. Record Findings: Document any immediate issues discovered during sniff testing.
Step 4: Review Previous Test Results
4.1. Obtain Test Reports: Get the test reports or logs from the first and second line teams.
4.2. Analyze Findings: Review their findings to understand what has been tested and any issues or bugs they encountered and resolved.
Step 5: Full-Fledged End-to-End Testing
5.1. Develop Test Cases: Create detailed test cases that cover all aspects of the SQL code, including edge cases and failure scenarios.
5.2. Execute Test Cases: Systematically run the test cases. This should include functional testing, integration testing, performance testing, and any other relevant types of testing.
5.3. Data Validation: Ensure that the SQL scripts interact correctly with the database and that data manipulation is accurate.
5.4. Regression Testing: Check that new changes have not adversely affected existing functionality.
5.5. Document Everything: Keep a detailed record of each test case, the results, and any issues found.
Step 6: Bug Reporting and Verification
6.1. Log Bugs: Document all bugs and issues found during testing. Use a bug-tracking tool if available.
6.2. Collaborate with Developers: Work closely with the LOB developers to ensure they understand the issues.
6.3. Verify Fixes: Once fixes are applied, re-test to verify that issues are resolved.
Step 7: Final Review and Sign-Off
7.1. Conduct a Final Review: After all tests are passed and bugs are fixed, review the entire testing process and outcomes.
7.2. Prepare a Test Report: Create a comprehensive test report that includes methodologies, test cases, results, bugs found, and fixes verified.
7.3. Sign-Off: Once satisfied, sign off on the testing process. Obtain approval from relevant stakeholders.
Step 8: Post-Testing Activities
8.1. Feedback Loop: Provide feedback to the LOB team for future improvements.
8.2. Update Documentation: Ensure all documentation is updated with any new findings or changes.
8.3. Archiving: Archive all test artifacts, scripts, and data for future reference.
Additional Considerations
Communication: Maintain clear and continuous communication with the LOB team and the first and second line teams throughout the testing process.
Compliance and Standards: Ensure all testing complies with organizational standards and best practices.
Risk Management: Continuously assess and manage risks throughout the testing process.
